    <h1>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Tag</h1>
    <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag is known as the document type declaration, or DTD. It is the first line of code in
        an HTML document and serves several purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Declares the document type: It indicates that the document is written in HTML5.</li>
        <li>Activates standards mode: It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode, rather than quirks
            mode.</li>
        <li>Defines the document's character encoding: It specifies the character encoding used in the document, such as
            UTF-8.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Meta Tags</h2>
    <p>The two meta tags have the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>: Specifies the character encoding of the HTML document as UTF-8.
        </li>
        <li><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>: Controls the
            viewport settings for mobile devices and responsive design.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By including these tags, you can ensure that your HTML document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displays text correctly, regardless of language or special characters.</li>
        <li>Adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a responsive user experience.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
