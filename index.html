    <!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> tag is known as the document type declaration, or DTD. It is the first line of code in an HTML document and serves several purposes:

1. Declares the document type: It indicates that the document is written in HTML5.
2. Activates standards mode: It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode, rather than quirks mode.
3. Defines the document's character encoding: It specifies the character encoding used in the document, such as UTF-8.

The <!DOCTYPE html> tag is a legacy from earlier versions of HTML, where it was used to reference a DTD (Document Type Definition) file that defined the rules and structure of the HTML language. In HTML5, this tag is simplified and no longer references a DTD file.

In summary, the <!DOCTYPE html> tag is essential for:

- Indicating the document is HTML5
- Ensuring standards mode rendering
- Defining character encoding

It's a mandatory tag and should be the first line of code in every HTML document. -->

<!-- The two meta tags have the following purposes:

<meta charset="UTF-8">:

1. Character Encoding: Specifies the character encoding of the HTML document as UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit).
2. Text Rendering: Ensures that the browser interprets the document's text correctly, displaying special characters and symbols as intended.
3. Language Support: UTF-8 supports a wide range of languages, including non-English characters, emojis, and special symbols.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:

1. Responsive Design: Controls the viewport settings for mobile devices and responsive design.
2. Screen Width: width=device-width sets the viewport width to match the device's screen width, ensuring a responsive layout.
3. Zoom Level: initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level to 1, ensuring the content fits the screen without scaling.
4. Mobile Optimization: Optimizes the document for mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.

In summary, these two meta tags:

1. Ensure proper character encoding and text rendering.
2. Optimize the document for mobile devices and responsive design.

By including these tags, you can ensure that your HTML document:

- Displays text correctly, regardless of language or special characters.
- Adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a responsive user experience. -->
